# Module 3 Challenge
##Customer Banking

There are three different files in this project: savings_account.py, cd_account.py and customer_banking.py. Account.py is just for setup purposes.

A file called __pycache__  was automatically generated. From what I found on ChatGPT, this is a file that speeds up the startup process so I'm leaving it in the repository. I will add __pycache__ to the .gitignore file in the future.  Please ignore this file.

This challenge involved setting up a savings account function and CD account function.  They were almost identical, which caused some confusion at first, but the instructor informed us that they are similar by design.  These two files were straightforward and the banking activity lessones we did in class were helpful.  

The customer_banking file was a bit more challenging.  However, I felt well prepared as it built upon the previous challenge.  

I did use Tabnine, which I again found helpful.  I also used ChatGPT, attended office hours and discussed this challenge with other students.
